# Build with CMake generated makefile.
#
# VERBOSE=1 causes the makefile outputting the compilation command.
# That is used sometimes to replay the compilation from the console.
# Mostly to substitute some options by -E so we get the preprocessing output.
# This because sometimes compile errors can only be understood with all
# preprocessor macros expanded.
#
# Ofcause and in general   it is nice not to depend on a IDE for compilation.
# So when the repo is cloned, you can build that easily too.
# cmake and make suffices and this script lets you issue a customized
# build from the command line.
